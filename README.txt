This is for the vulnerability recently discovered in Apple's iTunes and iCloud for windows. 

When these are installed in a system, they install another software caled Bonjour. 
But when these are being uninstalled, they do not remove the Bonjour software. 
This software has an unquoted service path vulnerability which makes a system prone to ransomware attacks. 

Thus the presence of Bonjour without iTunes or iCloud makes a system susceptible to attacks.

The zip folder named "exe.win32-3.7" has an exe that can be executed directly without any installation.
